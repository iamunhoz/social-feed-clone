## Backend Information


### **About index.html**

Instead of serving a static `index.html`, a dynamic one is generated by the server with the module `template.js`

### **About sensible data**

The module `/config/config.js` expects the existence of the following environment variables: 1. MONGO_USER
1. MONGO_PASSWORD
1. MONGO_URI
1. MONGO_DEFAULT_DB
1. JWT_SECRET

Variables 1 to 3 are required by the module `mongoose` to connect to a MongoDB server, be it local or in the MongoDB Atlas cloud, like the above demonstration page. The last variable is to generate singular hashs for the jwt authentication tokens.
